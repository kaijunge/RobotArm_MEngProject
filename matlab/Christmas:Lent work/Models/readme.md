VSA_sanity_check: 
A model used to try make sure the VSA model is correct compared to yddot = u. 
Translational motion

VSA_sanity_check_rotation:
Same as VSA_sanity_check but for rotational components. Getting the inertia correct and things like that. 

VSA_sanity_check_energy: 
Used to debug why one system was getting "free energy" while it should not be. 

simple_VSA_model: 
includes just the motor and the spring is a force input to the second link 

VSA_model1: 
Tries to replicate the mechanical model of AWAS-II / CompACT VSA
